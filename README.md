# Snake-Game
	A simple snake game project that was created in JavaFX graphics that allows the user to control the object/snake on the screen. 
  The user can move the snake in three directions (forward, left, or right). The snake object grows when it eats the food on the screen. 
  The game ends when the user hits the wall or hits its head with any part of its body.
